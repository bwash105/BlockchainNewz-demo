            <p>Miles from the sunrise. The first time I heard 'Peggy Sue'. You can cut them with a knife. Take my phone. Maladies. Oh Lord, don't keep me up all night. First time I smoked. To the women I love. And the war was cold. But my heart is allergic. My heart can stand a disaster. Though I don't know why it's there. Now many wars have come and gone. My hand can't touch a guitar string. Numbers swirling thick and curious</p>

            <p>Burning money when I get it. At the domino table, Tony had told him that he.... That was hot and I want ice. I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun. I guess I really am a vanity slave. My innocence really eventually see a endurance surrendering. Acompa√±ame a Trazar. My mama is stressing, my daddy tired. and you working with two left feet at the skating rink.

            <p>Move too fast, You'll end up never knowing... I'm wastin' my time by goin' to school. The drums, a fire, a calling . Her best friend can't help her. Now you've taken all my money. When it comes to love, got to take it easy. Ahh, got to learn to let the river flow. What are you gonna do. Have you come to fight the war . Hello, hello, sad angel . Have you come to fight the war . With a prayer and a curse . Your dreams would not wake . My eyes saw the words</p>
